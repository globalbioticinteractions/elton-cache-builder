Global Biotic Interactions: Elton Dataset Cache

The intended use of this archive/cache is to allow for offline-enabled access versions of existing species interaction datasets. The program "Elton" (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.998263) was used to populate the content of elton-datasets.tar.gz . The same program can be used to extract information from the cache archive also. Global Biotic Interactions (https://globalbioticinteractions.org, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.08.005) also uses these archives to create derived species interaction data archives, search indexes and APIs. 

Please note that due to size considerations, offline-enabled access to an elton dataset cache of iNaturalist interaction data has been excluded from this publications and moved into a separate Zenodo publication at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3950546 .

Usage
-----

To install, extract elton-datasets.tar.gz into a directory of choice using:

tar xfz elton-dataset.tar.gz

To use, download elton.jar included this publication and execute the following to get a list of available datasets:

java -Xmx4G -jar elton.jar datasets

on a system that has java v8+ installed.

If all goes well, you should be able to regenerate the included file elton-dataset.tsv . 

For more information on how to use elton.jar, execute:

java -jar elton.jar usage

or visit https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton for more available commands.

Alternatively, without using Elton, you can access the data by inspecting the access.tsv files in the various directories of the datasets directory.

When using these datasets in a publication or product, please cite the *original* data providers and publications. You can find the citations in the data.
